We have decided to create a simple design for a contact list. There is

- A tittle,
- A "type your name" box, a contact list that displays contact names with their
corresponding intials.

There are five bottons each with a different feature

- Add contacts to the list
- Delete contacts of the list
- Edit names of the contacts
- Refresh button
- Sort button that lets you sort the contacts
  from A-z
